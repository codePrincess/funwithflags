# Fun with Flags
If colleagues like [Starlord Daniel](https://github.com/starlord-daniel) need help to entertain the masses at a students BBQ I'm there to help :D 

So this little iOS app "Fun with Flags" was created. And yes, it's a hommage to Sheldon Cooper's show. Have fun playing around with it and use it as you wish!
